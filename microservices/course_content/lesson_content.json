We will discuss the basic structure of a neural network, including input, hidden, and output layers. Additionally, we will explore the different types of neural networks, such as feedforward and recurrent networks.\n\nNeural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are widely used in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n\nThe basic structure of a neural network consists of three main components: input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer. The input layer receives the initial data or features, which are then passed through the hidden layers to generate the final output. Each layer is composed of multiple interconnected nodes, also known as neurons.\n\nThe input layer is responsible for receiving the input data and passing it to the hidden layers. The hidden layers perform computations on the input data using mathematical functions called activation functions. These computations involve adjusting the weights and biases associated with each connection between neurons. The output layer produces the final result or prediction based on the computations performed in the hidden layers.\n\nThere are different types of neural networks, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. One common type is the feedforward neural network, where information flows only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer. This type of network is often used for tasks such as classification and regression.\n\nAnother type of neural network is the recurrent neural network (RNN), which has connections that allow information to flow in cycles or loops. RNNs are particularly useful for tasks involving sequential data, such as speech recognition and natural language processing. They can capture temporal dependencies and context in the data.\n\nIn summary, neural networks are powerful machine learning models that mimic the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of neurons, including input, hidden, and output layers. Different types of neural networks, such as feedforward and recurrent networks, are used for different applications. In the next lesson, we will dive deeper into the working principles of neural networks and explore how they learn from data."
