We will discuss the basic structure of a neural network, including input and output layers, hidden layers, and activation functions. We will also explore the different types of neural networks, such as feedforward and recurrent networks.\\n\\nNeural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are widely used in various fields, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.\\n\\nThe basic structure of a neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons. The first layer is the input layer, which receives the initial data or features. The last layer is the output layer, which produces the final prediction or classification. In between, there can be one or more hidden layers, which perform complex computations and transformations on the input data.\\n\\nEach neuron in a neural network receives inputs from the previous layer, applies a mathematical operation to them, and produces an output. The outputs of the neurons in one layer serve as inputs to the neurons in the next layer. This process continues until the final output is generated.\\n\\nActivation functions play a crucial role in neural networks. They introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, the hyperbolic tangent function, and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function.\\n\\nFeedforward neural networks are the most basic type of neural network. They propagate the input data forward through the layers, without any feedback connections. They are commonly used for tasks such as classification and regression.\\n\\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) are another type of neural network that can handle sequential data, such as time series or natural language. RNNs have feedback connections, which allow them to capture temporal dependencies and process data with varying lengths.\\n\\nIn summary, neural networks are powerful machine learning models that can learn complex patterns and relationships in data. They consist of layers of interconnected neurons, with activation functions introducing non-linearity. Feedforward networks are used for tasks like classification, while recurrent networks are suitable for sequential data. In the next lesson, we will dive deeper into the working principles of neural networks and explore how they learn from data.\"}",
