Your purpose could greatly impact how we approach the learning journey. For example, if you aim to develop hands-on applications using transformers in e-commerce, we can focus more on practical implementation and case studies. On the other hand, if you seek a high-level overview for strategic decision-making, we can emphasize the business implications and use cases. Please share your purpose of learning below with as much detail as possible. \ud83d\ude80"
